# GmailReader
Python3 code to read and use a Gmail account and do what you want with it. Just be creative

this code it's a mixture of my own and what I found on the [Gmail Api Docs for Python](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/python), so I don't think I might have the rights to ask you to give me the credits of it, but if you want (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧ ✧ﾟ･: *ヽ(◕ヮ◕ヽ)

the runing example is the [init.py](https://github.com/razielku/GmailReader/blob/master/init.py) file
# More info
I let in the code the links where I found something helpful to me, but I put them here for order reasons:
 - [Google APIs Client Library for Python Installation](https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/python/start/installation) (you need this)
 - [Oauth2 Protocol](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2)
 - [Api Client Oauth Guide](https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/python/guide/aaa_oauth)
 - [Console Help for Credentials, access, security, and identity](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158857?hl=en&ref_topic=6262490)
 - [Gmail Api Auth Scopes Info](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/auth/scopes#gmail_scopes)
  
You need to enter to your [Google developer Console](https://console.developers.google.com) to enable the [Gmail Api](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/gmail/overview) and generate a secret.json file in the [Google Developer Console Api Credentials List](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials)

# Why I did this code?
I did this code, cause in my work I have the minor task of check the failure emails, a repetitive task I wanted to automate, and I came out with this, it works, at least for me.
